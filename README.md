# Àñ¬∞.‚úßüìì Dev Diary üìì‚úßÀñ¬∞

## ‚ú® Summary  
Dev Diary is a personal markdown-based logging platform built for developers to document bugs, errors, and setup processes across coding projects. It helps you keep track of technical challenges in an organized, personalized way, paired with an AI assistant. With a centralized memory bank and a chatbot that guides you through documentation, error fixes, and helpful tools, creating personal projects feels a little less overwhelming (especially for new developers) while also making the process more reflective and focused on learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  

### 1. Markdown Documentation  
- Error title  
- Error message  
- Code snippets  
- How the error was fixed  
- Personal notes  
- Links/resources (GitHub repo, YouTube, Stack Overflow)  
- Setup docs for environments, package installs, and commands  
- Syntax/reference notes when learning a new language or framework  

### 2. AI Assistant  
- Explains error messages in context with common solutions  
- Suggests YouTube tutorials or Stack Overflow posts  
- Offers debugging strategies & terminal command hints  
- Can generate markdown logs or setup docs based on a brief description (great for beginners on a new stack)  

### 3. Error Tagging & Search  
- By language (Python, Java, C++, SQL, etc.)  
- By error type (syntax, runtime, permission, import)  
- By framework/tool (React, Django, Tailwind CSS, etc.)  
- By system/OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
- By error status (unresolved, resolved, in-progress)  
- Custom tags by user  
- Full-text search across projects and docs  

### 4. User Authentication  
- Sign up  
- Login  
- Password recovery

## üå± Inspiration  

Last semester during ACM, my team kept running into the same recurring issue with Ngrok. Every time, we‚Äôd have to dig through Stack Overflow posts, external docs, or ask chatgpt for the right terminal commands to fix it. Our industry mentor gave us a helpful tip that she uses on the job: document every error we encounter in a Google Doc or notes app so we can refer back to it if it happens again.

Since then, I‚Äôve been in the habit of jotting down error fixes and environment setup instructions in OneNote for my personal projects. When I switched from Java to Python for LeetCode, I also used Notion to keep track of syntax differences and helpful patterns. But over time, my notes became really cluttered and hard to navigate. That got me thinking: what if there were a more centralized, organized platform where developers could store these logs and revisit them easily, with a clean, user friendly interface?

## ‚öîÔ∏è Competition  

- **Sentry** ‚Üí error tracking for production apps, not personal learning logs  
- **Stack Overflow** ‚Üí huge Q&A base but not personal/project-specific  
- **Notion** ‚Üí general note app, not optimized for error tagging/search  
- **DevDocs** ‚Üí good for reading docs, not logging/analysis  
- **GeeksforGeeks** ‚Üí tutorials only, no personalized logs or AI fixes
